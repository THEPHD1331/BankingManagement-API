# BankingManagement-API

This is a Banking Management REST CRUD API made in Spring Boot.

 I designed and developed a robust Banking Management REST CRUD API project using Spring Boot. This project seamlessly handles the essential components of the banking ecosystem, including Banks, Branches, Accounts, Loans, Customers, and Transactions.

# Key Features:

Entity Relationship Modeling: 

The project incorporates a well-defined entity relationship model, ensuring accurate representation of the banking domain. It includes entities such as Banks, Branches, Accounts, Loans, Customers, and Transactions, with appropriate attributes and relationships between them.

CRUD Operations with Spring Data JPA: 

Leveraging Spring Data JPA, I seamlessly implemented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity. This framework automates database interactions, reducing boilerplate code and optimizing data access.

Spring Security Integration: 

To prioritize data security and access control, I integrated Spring Security into the API. This provides authentication and authorization mechanisms, safeguarding sensitive banking data and ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.

Actuator Implementation: 

The incorporation of Spring Boot Actuator enables real-time monitoring and management of the application. This includes features such as health checks, metrics, and application information, ensuring optimal performance and troubleshooting capabilities.

Thorough Testing: 

I implemented comprehensive unit tests and integration tests using Spring Boot's testing framework. This ensures the reliability and stability of the API by validating various use cases, edge cases, and scenarios.

External API Communication: 

The project demonstrates proficiency in communicating with external APIs. It integrates with third-party services for tasks such as currency conversion, real-time market data, or credit score retrieval, enhancing the functionality and reliability of the application.

RESTful Architecture: 

The API adheres to RESTful principles, ensuring that endpoints are logically structured and adhere to standard HTTP methods. This promotes a clear and predictable interaction pattern for clients of the API.

Documentation: 

I ensured that the API endpoints are well-documented using tools such as Swagger. This documentation simplifies API consumption for other developers, streamlines onboarding, and improves collaboration.
